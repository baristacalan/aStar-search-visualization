# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

This project aims to find the shortest path in a maze using the A* algorithm and visualize it step-by-step in the terminal. 

## Inspirations 

This project is based on a tutorial from GeeksforGeeks(Article written by *Rachit Belwariar*). The code has been adapted and enhanced for educational purposes. It serves as a self-learning tool for understanding the A* algorithm and how it can be implemented in C++.

## Features

- Finds the shortest path using the A* algorithm.
- Visualizes the algorithm step-by-step in the terminal.
- Color codes:
  - Starting point: Purple
  - Ending point: White
  - Obstacle: Red
  - Free cell: Yellow
  - Path: Green

## Usage

The project is written in C++ and is intended to be run in a terminal.
